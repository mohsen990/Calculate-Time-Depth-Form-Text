To extract time adverbs from a text and map them to codes representing the depth of time (from past to future), you can follow these steps:

1- Create a dictionary of time adverbs categorized by their depth of time.

2- Preprocess the text to identify and extract these adverbs.

3- Map each adverb to a corresponding code that represents its depth of time.

4- Return or store the results for further analysis.
