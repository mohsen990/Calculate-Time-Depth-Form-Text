To extract time adverbs from a text and map them to codes representing the depth of time (from past to future), you can follow these steps:

Create a dictionary of time adverbs categorized by their depth of time.
Preprocess the text to identify and extract these adverbs.
Map each adverb to a corresponding code that represents its depth of time.
Return or store the results for further analysis.
